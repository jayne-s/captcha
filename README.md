# captcha

An application created using Swift and XCode that simulates a CAPTCHA verification. Users first pick an image with the text 'cefg' and then transition to the next screen where they must listen to an audio source and select the button with matching text. If the user fails in selecting the correct image within two tries, a segue to a screen displaying "You are a bot!" is triggered. However, in the audio captcha, user have unlimited tries, and if they succeed, a segue is triggered leading them to a final screen, signifying the end of the captcha application.
